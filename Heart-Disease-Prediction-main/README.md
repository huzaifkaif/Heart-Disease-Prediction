# Heart Disease Prediction

Built machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease using clinical data (age, chest pain type, blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate).

Conducted thorough EDA to identify risk factors and correlations with cardiovascular outcomes.

Recommended actionable insights for hospitals to improve early detection and prevention strategies.

Compared ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, SVM) to optimize prediction accuracy.
